# Tutorials Application

## Project Overview
This Tutorials application provides a platform for users to browse, enroll in, and manage tutorial courses. It's built using Express.js with MongoDB, and supports various view engines such as Handlebars, EJS, and Pug. Guests can view the homepage, register, and log in, while logged-in users can interact with more in-depth functionalities like enrolling in courses or managing courses they've created.

## Features

### Guest Users
- **Homepage**: Display top three public courses or a message if no courses are available.
- **Registration and Login**: Guest users can register and log in to access more features.

### Logged-In Users
- **Course Browsing**: All public courses are listed with an option to view detailed pages.
- **Course Management**: Users can create new courses, edit existing ones, and enroll in courses.

### Database Models
- **Users**: Identified by a unique username and password, with a list of enrolled courses.
- **Courses**: Include details like title, description, image URL, duration, and creation date.

## Security
Security measures are implemented to ensure that only appropriate users can access specific functionalities. For instance, only the course creator can edit or delete a course.

## Validation
- **User Credentials**: Username and password must be at least 5 characters long, containing only English letters and digits.
- **Courses**: Validations include checks on the length of the title and description, and proper formatting of the image URL.
